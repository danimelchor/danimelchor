Master's degree program while there.

an international company focused on process automation using AI.

I am currently working as a SWE at BastionZero during the academic year, and as a SWE intern at Stripe during the summer.

My GitHub organizations: [Decentrapass](https://github.com/Decentrapass) and [BU Nexus](https://github.com/Boston-University-Nexus)

Current  interests:  computer  science,   effective  altruism,  nutrition,  financial
independence, cryptocurrencies.

# Daniel Melchor

Hey there!

I'm  a  19-year-old  student  from   Spain   studying  at   Boston University.   I am
pursuing a major in Computer Science,  and,  most  likely,  completing an accelerated
Master's degree program while there.

Last summer, I worked as a Machine Learning developer at Intelygenz,
an international company focused on process automation using AI.

I am currently working as a SWE at BastionZero during the academic year, and as a SWE intern at Stripe during the summer.

My GitHub organizations: [Decentrapass](https://github.com/Decentrapass) and [BU Nexus](https://github.com/Boston-University-Nexus)

Current  interests:  computer  science,   effective  altruism,  nutrition,  financial
independence, cryptocurrencies.

Random  topics  we  can  talk  about: canoe trips, web development, animal suffering,
American college experience, politics, religion, blockchainâ€¦

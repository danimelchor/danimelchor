Hey there!

I'm  a  20-year-old  student  from   Spain   studying  at   Boston University.   I am
pursuing a major in Computer Science with the expected (early) graduation date of May 2023.

Last semester, I worked as a SWE at BastionZero. And this summer, I worked as a SWE intern at Stripe. I will be joining Stripe
as a fulltime employee on Summer 2023.
